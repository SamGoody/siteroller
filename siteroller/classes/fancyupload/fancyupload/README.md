FancyUpload - Swiff meets Ajax
========================

**[Swiff](http://www.adobe.com/products/flashplayer/)** meets **Ajax** for powerful and elegant uploads.
FancyUpload is a file-input replacement which features an unobtrusive, multiple-file selection
menu and queued upload with an animated progress bar. It is easy to setup, is server independent,
completely styleable via CSS and XHTML and uses [MooTools][] to work in all modern browsers.
